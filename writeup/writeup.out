\BOOKMARK [3][-]{subsubsection.1.2.1}{Describe how \(and identify where in your code\) you implemented a sliding window search. How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?}{subsection.1.2}% 6

\BOOKMARK [3][-]{subsubsection.1.3.1}{Provide a link to your final video output. Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video \(somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.\)}{subsection.1.3}% 9
